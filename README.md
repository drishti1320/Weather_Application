Weather_Applicatioin

A Weather Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web-based tool designed to display real-time weather data for a specific location. The app typically fetches data from a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, and presents key information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (sunny, rainy, etc.) to users.
